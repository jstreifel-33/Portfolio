## Professional Pitch

Hello, my name is Joseph Streifel and I'm a web developer. Before starting my career in tech, I worked in the calibration industry both in the United States Marine Corps and in the private sector. While working in calibration, I developed a strong attention to detail and gained experience with quality systems and compliance to technical standards, such as ISO 17025 and ANSI Z540.3. I decided to transition to software engineering because I wanted to take on a new challenge in a field where I can continue to grow professionally. Web development is my current focus and I'd like to bring the skills I've gained to a tech company in the greater Washington area. I'm passionate about personal growth and plan to learn and teach as much as I can wherever I go, while providing high quality work and products in whatever setting I find myself in.

## What excites you about tech?

Science fiction once imagined all of human knowledge being accessible to anyone, and now we live that reality. My aim is to join the tech industry at the forefront of the information age and contribute to progressive, innovative, and elegant software solutions.
